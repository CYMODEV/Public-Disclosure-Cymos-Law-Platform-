# Public-Disclosure-Cymos-Law-Platform-
Cymos is a consent‑first, programmable law platform that embeds enforceable compliance, dispute resolution, and auditability into Web3 applications. This public disclosure explains product scope, governance, IP posture, regulatory posture, risks, and intended use of funds associated.
CYMOS AI Law Platform is a consent‑first, programmable law infrastructure that embeds enforceable compliance, dispute resolution, and auditable evidence flows into Web3 applications and enterprise workflows. This public disclosure explains the scope of the governance model, IP posture, regulatory stance, material risks, and intended use of funds tied to the repository and current fundraising round.

• Core Policy DSL reference implementation (compiler + runtime) under a developer‑friendly license.
• SDKs and stubs (JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust) plus example integrations for marketplaces, wallets, and games.
• Reference smart contracts: Consent Vault, Audit Trail Ledger, Escrow & Royalty Split templates.
• Operational playbooks: dispute workflows, evidence bundle schema, test suites, and CI checks.
• Documentation: API spec, onboarding guide, governance charter, contribution guidelines, security checklist.


Governance and decision rights

• Steering Council governs protocol‑level policy changes; full governance charter is in the repo.
• Core DSL or critical contract changes require: RFC → developer review → security audit sign‑off → Council ratification and multi‑sig deployment.
• Community contributions accepted via pull requests and formal RFC flow; high‑impact changes follow an opt‑in upgrade path for deployed instances.


Licenses and contributor terms

• Code licensing: dual model — permissive SDK license (MIT or Apache‑2.0) for integrations; modular core primitives under a compatibility‑preserving license to maintain compliance guarantees.
• Creative assets : copyrighted; default NFT licensing templates included but creators can select alternate licensing.
• Contributor License Agreement (CLA): contributors grant CYMOS a non‑exclusive license to use, modify, and distribute contributions to ensure interoperability and public compliance testing.


Intellectual property and enforcement

• CYMOS will pursue IP protection for core technical inventions (Policy DSL compilation methods, on‑chain audit anchoring) while keeping reference implementations available for adoption.
• Trade secrets (proprietary ML models and private compliance heuristics) are retained off‑repo and integrated via documented APIs.
• IP notices, trademark policies, and takedown procedures are published in the repo’s legal folder.


Regulatory and compliance posture

• Platform is built for “compliance‑first” operation: consent receipts, revocation, purpose limitation, and immutable audit anchors.
• Regional feature toggles allow operators to enable/disable or alter features to meet local laws (e.g., GDPR, MiCA, FinCEN).
• CYMOS provides an evidence export format and Regulator API for authorized oversight and reporting.


Security and audits

• Protocol primitives will undergo third‑party security audits before any production mainnet deployment.
• Bug bounty program and responsible disclosure process are published in the repo.
• Emergency rollback and multi‑sig upgrade procedures are documented for crisis response.


Material risks (non‑exhaustive)

• Regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions may require modification of features and slow adoption.
• Smart contract exploits, oracle failures, or governance capture could impact platform integrity.
• IP disputes or claims related to AI training data or third‑party content may necessitate legal defense and product adjustments.
• Adoption risk: developer and enterprise uptake may be slower than projected.
• Funding risk: planned financing rounds may change timing, structure, or terms.


Use of repo and community expectations

• The repo is the canonical source for DSL specs, SDKs, RFCs, and audit artifacts.
• Contributors must follow published security, testing, and contribution guidelines.
• Commercial forks and deployments are allowed per license terms; projects claiming “CYMOS‑compliant” status must pass the official verification checklist to use CYMOS branding.

Value Proposition — CYMOS AI Law Platform 

For Developers

• Plug‑and‑play compliance: SDKs and APIs handle consent, royalties, dispute hooks, and audit logs so teams ship faster.
• Machine‑readable legal primitives: implement enforceable policies without bespoke legal engineering.
• Reference apps and test suites: marketplace, wallet, and prophecy‑game examples to shorten integration time.
• Open RFC process: extend the Policy DSL while maintaining auditability and compatibility.


For Open‑Source Maintainers

• Standardized legal primitives reduce fragmentation and legal uncertainty across forks.
• Contribution model balances openness with protection of core compliance guarantees.
• Tooling to generate consent receipts and evidence bundles directly from repo actions and CI/PR metadata.


For Enterprises & Regulators

• Compliance‑native infrastructure reduces audit and reporting overhead.
• Regulator API and exportable evidence bundles simplify oversight and investigations.
• Configurable regional toggles and enterprise controls enable practical adoption in regulated jurisdictions.


For Investors

• Differentiated moat: “law as code” that combines IP, compliance automation, and dispute resolution into platform economics.
• Multiple monetization vectors: protocol fees, enterprise licenses, managed compliance services, verification/attestation services, and professional services.
• Network effects: developer adoption increases data depth, dispute precedent, and platform defensibility.
